# Contributing to Cossistant

👋 Hey there — thanks for your interest in Cossistant!

This project is still in its **early development phase**, and we’re currently focused on building a solid, secure, and scalable foundation before accepting external contributions.

---

## 🚧 Pull Requests

We’re **not accepting public pull requests just yet**.

Why?

- The core architecture is still evolving rapidly.
- Interfaces, abstractions, and structure may change week-to-week.
- We want to avoid wasting your time on PRs that might get rewritten or rejected due to architectural shifts.

Once the foundation is stable, we’ll **open contributions with clear scopes, issues, and guidance**.

---

## ✅ What You _Can_ Do Right Now

- **Star the repo** to support the project.
- **Open issues** to report bugs, suggest features, or discuss implementation ideas.
- **Help shape the roadmap** — we read every issue and discussion.
- **Share feedback** on the API, SDK structure, or early docs.
- **Join the waitlist or early access** once announced.

---

## 🛡️ Our Commitment

When we open contributions, we’ll make it worth your time:

- Clear contribution guidelines
- Well-documented code
- Modular architecture
- Respect for your effort
